# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains (adapted) notebooks and related code from Udacity's Deep Learning GAN lesson, part of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Programme](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

* **Part 1:** A simple GAN for image generation made of two feedforward components and trained on the MNIST dataset. Lot's of explanation of the general principle and architecture of GANs.
* **Part 2:** A more complex DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) for image generation on Googles Housenumbers dataset. Introducing the concept / code for DCGANs. Lot's of explanations.
* **Part 3a:** Quite similar to the 2nd notebook, but the DCGAN is somewhat deeper to deal with a more complex task and dataset: human faces. Less explanations than in part 2.
* **Part 3b:** An 2nd version of 3a, with some code and conceptual improvements and also a deeper and more complex model. (Results after a couple of epochs are promising but training time has exploded ...)
* **Part 4:** Introduction of the principle of Cycle GANs for 'style transfer' between images. Lots of explanations for this quite complicated architecture.
