# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This repo contains (adapted) notebooks and related code from Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson, part of the [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

* **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
* **Part 2:** Building fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
* **Part 3:** How to train a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST
* **Part 4:** Exercise - train a neural network on Fashion-MNIST
* **Part 5:** Making predictions and validating networks
* **Part 6:** How to save and load trained models
* **Part 7:** Load image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
* **Part 8:** Use transfer learning to train a state-of-the-art image classifier for dogs and cats
* **Parts 9a / 9b:** Two examples of training and evaluating pretrained CNNs for image classifcation (slight code differences)
* **Part 10:** A fully defined network with separate validation set and 'early stopping' (BEST!)
* **CNN_exercice_CIFAR10:** An additional exercice, this time with a simple CNN built from scratch (no transfer learning)
