# Constructing Neural Nets from Scratch with Numpy


* **Part 1:** Walkthrough to building a simple linear NN with Numpy - get the basics right.

* **Part 2:** Building a neural network for binary text classification / sentiment analysis based on movie reviews.
              (It is the same task / data set that on which the project [sentiment analysis for movie reviews](https://github.com/rbuerki/projects-dl/tree/master/sentiment_analysis_LSTM_movie_reviews) with LSTM is based.)
              This is a great project with 3 very interesting parts.
        - Part 1) How to frame the problem and build intuition
        - Part 2) How to build the Neural Net
        - Part 3) How to tune the Neural Net for better perfomance

* **Part 3:** A demo on weight initialization for NN tuning, not an actual project.

**Other:**
- There is also another notebook that demonstrates the mechanics of attention in seq2seq models. It is not really related to the other content ... altough it, accidentially, is a _nice visualization of the different vector multiplication methods_ used in building NNs:
- np.dot()
- np.matmul()
- simple multiplication *
