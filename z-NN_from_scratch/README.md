# Constructing Neural Nets from Scratch with Numpy


* **Part 1:** Walkthrough to building a simple linear NN with Numpy - get the basics right.

* **Part 2:** Building a neural network for binary text classification / sentiment analysis based on movie reviews.
              (It is the same task / data set that on which the project [sentiment analysis for movie reviews](https://github.com/rbuerki/projects-dl/tree/master/sentiment_analysis_LSTM_movie_reviews) with LSTM is based.)
              This is a great project with 3 very interesting parts.
        - Part 1) How to frame the problem and build intuition
        - Part 2) How to build the Neural Net
        - Part 3) How to tune the Neural Net for better perfomance



**Other:** There is also some additional notebooks that demonstrate certain concepts and are not actual projects:

* **Attention:** Very specific, this notebook demonstrates the mechanics of attention in seq2seq models ... but it is, accidentially, also a _nice visualization of the different vector multiplication methods_ used in building NNs: np.dot() | np.matmul() | simple multiplication *

* **Batch Normalization:** More generic, a demo on batch normalization for NN optimization

* **Weight initialization:** More generic, a demo on weight initialization for NN tuning
