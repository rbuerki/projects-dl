# Autoencoders for image compression / decompression and denoising

This repo contains (adapted) notebooks and related code from Udacity's Deep Learning with PyTorch lesson, part of the [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

* **Part 1:** Introduction to Autoencoding, walktrough with a simple linear NN
* **Part 2a:** Building a (little) more sophisticated convolutional autoencoder using transpose convolution for decompression
* **Part 2b:** Improving the results with a different de-convolution method (combining upscaling and convolution)
* **Part 3:** Building a deeper, more complex convolutional autoencoder for the harder task of image denoising

All notebooks are based on the MNIST dataset.
